# Project - EDA with Pandas Using the Boston Housing Data

## Introduction

In this section you've learned a lot about importing, cleaning up, analysing (using descriptive statistics) and visualizing data. In this more free form project you'll get a chance to practice all of these skills with the Boston Housing data set.

## Objectives
You will be able to:
* Show mastery of the content covered in this section

# Goals

Use your data munging and visualization skills to conduct an exploratory analysis of the dataset below. At minimum, this should include:

* Loading the data (which is stored in the file train.csv)
* Finding variables with high correlation (use the np.corrcoeff method in combination with iteration)
* Commenting on the distribution of at least 3 variables
* Creating a box plot
* Investigate other potential relations

# Variable Descriptions

This data frame contains the following columns:

#### crim  
per capita crime rate by town.

#### zn  
proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.

#### indus  
proportion of non-retail business acres per town.

#### chas  
Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise).

#### nox  
nitrogen oxides concentration (parts per 10 million).

#### rm  
average number of rooms per dwelling.

#### age  
proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940.

#### dis  
weighted mean of distances to five Boston employment centres.

#### rad  
index of accessibility to radial highways.

#### tax  
full-value property-tax rate per $10,000.

#### ptratio  
pupil-teacher ratio by town.

#### black  
1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of blacks by town.

#### lstat  
lower status of the population (percent).

#### medv  
median value of owner-occupied homes in $10000s.
